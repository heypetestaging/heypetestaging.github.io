This page contains details of my commonly used PGP keys. You can use these keys to verify digital signatures in messages I've sent or to send me encrypted messages.

Please verify the identifying characteristics (key ID and fingerprints) of my keys with the information below before sending me signed or encrypted mail.

I encourage you to send me PGP signed/encrypted mail when you contact me.

Note: As of 2011-11-27, I've moved one primary key (0xDA122186 and its encryption subkey 0x19DF6C14) to secure offline storage. I have published new subkeys for both signing and encryption, and they are available here and on public keyservers. If you have an older copy of this public key, please update to the latest version. In general, it's a good idea to update your public keyring on a regular basis.

See here and here for more information about subkeys and why they're a good idea.

For those who are interested, my active subkeys for key 0xDA122186 are stored on a German Privacy Foundation Crypto Stick. The primary and subkeys for 0x85EB9F44 are stored on separate OpenPGP smartcards. Both are an excellent way of securely storing one's keys.
